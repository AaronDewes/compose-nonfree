  tagline: Self-host your photo and video library
  description: "PhotoPrism\xAE is a privately hosted app for browsing, organizing,\
    \ and sharing your photo collection. It makes use of the latest technologies to\
    \ tag and find pictures automatically without getting in your way. Say goodbye\
    \ to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud!\n\n\
    - Our intuitive user interface makes browsing and organizing your photo collection\
    \ as easy as it should be \u2014 whether it\u2019s on a phone, tablet, or desktop\
    \ computer.\n\n- Index everything without worrying about duplicates or RAW to\
    \ JPEG conversion.\n\n- Automatic image classification based on Google TensorFlow.\
    \ In addition, our indexer detects colors, chroma, luminance, quality, panoramic\
    \ projection, location type, and many other properties.\n\n- Includes four high-resolution\
    \ world maps to see where you've been, and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots.\n\
    \n- WebDAV clients, like Microsoft\u2019s Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder,\
    \ may connect directly to PhotoPrism so that you to can open, edit, and delete\
    \ files from your computer or phone as if they were local. You may easily sync\
    \ your pictures with PhotoSync as well.\n\n- Because PhotoPrism is built as a\
    \ progressive web app, it provides a native app-like experience, and you may install\
    \ it on your home screen. There's also a community-maintained native app in development."
