  tagline: Run VS Code on your Umbrel
  description: 'Run VS Code on your Umbrel and access it in the browser so you can
    code on any device with a consistent development environment. This way you can
    use your Umbrel not only to code from any device, anywhere, but to also speed
    up tests, compilations, downloads, and more.


    By running all intensive tasks run on your Umbrel, preserve battery life of your
    devices when you''re on the go.'
