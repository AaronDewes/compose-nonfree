  description: >-
    LN Markets is the first Lightning-native Bitcoin derivatives trading platform.
    
    
    LN Markets enables traders to take minimal counterparty risk:
      you can trade directly from your Lightning wallet for instant and almost costless transactions.
      Since March 2020, we have processed over $200 million of trading volume,
      with a median fee of 1 sat for instant P&L delivery to your wallet.
      
      
    This app gives you another way to interact with LN Markets:
      you can directly deposit, withdraw, get trading stats and get instantly connected to your account to take positions as usual.
      More features may come in the future!
