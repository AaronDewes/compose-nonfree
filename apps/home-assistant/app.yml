  tagline: Home automation that puts local control & privacy first
  description: >-
    Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first,
    powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Home Assistant
    integrates with over a thousand different devices and services. Once you have
    integrated all your devices at home, you can unleash Home Assistantâ€™s advanced
    automation engine to make your home work for you. Examples:
    
    
    - Turn on the light when the sun sets or when coming home
    
    - Alert you when you leave your garage door open
    
    All your smart home data stays local. Home Assistant communicates
    with your devices locally, and will fallback to pulling in data from the cloud
    if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything
    is processed locally.
