  tagline: Block ads on your entire network
  description: "Instead of browser plugins or other software on each computer, install\
    \ Pi-hole\xAE on your Umbrel and your entire network is protected. Network-level\
    \ blocking allows you to block ads in non-traditional places such as mobile apps\
    \ and smart TVs, regardless of hardware or OS. Since advertisements are blocked\
    \ before they are downloaded, network performance is improved and will feel faster.\
    \ \n\nIn addition to blocking advertisements, Pi-hole\xAE has an informative Web\
    \ interface that shows stats on all the domains being queried on your network.\
    \ Pi-hole\xAE works fine with an existing DHCP server, but you can use Pi-hole\xAE\
    \u2019s to keep your network management in one place.\n\n Pi-hole\xAE and the\
    \ Pi-hole\xAE logo are registered trademarks of Pi-hole. Umbrel is not sponsored,\
    \ endorsed by, or associated with Pi-hole\xAE."
