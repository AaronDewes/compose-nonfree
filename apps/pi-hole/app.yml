  tagline: Block ads on your entire network
  description: >-
    Instead of browser plugins or other software on each computer, install
    Pi-hole® on your Umbrel and your entire network is protected. Network-level
    blocking allows you to block ads in non-traditional places such as mobile apps
    and smart TVs, regardless of hardware or OS. Since advertisements are blocked
    before they are downloaded, network performance is improved and will feel faster.
    
    
    
    In addition to blocking advertisements, Pi-hole® has an informative
    Web interface that shows stats on all the domains being queried on your network.
    Pi-hole® works fine with an existing DHCP server, but you can use Pi-hole's
    to keep your network management in one place.
